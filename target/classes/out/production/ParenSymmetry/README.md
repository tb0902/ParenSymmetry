# src.main.java.ParenSymmetry
balance is found except when it's not



Write two methods:
- Write a method `isBalanced` that takes a string, and produces true if balanced, false otherwise. 
The method signature should be: `public boolean isBalanced(String stringToTest);`
- Write another method `checkFile` that use the first to check a file of paren strings producing a true or false for each line in the file. 
- It should look like `public void checkFile(String filename);`
